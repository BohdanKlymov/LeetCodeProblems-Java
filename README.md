# LeetCodeProblems-Java

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems solved using Java.

The main goal of this project is to improve my programming skills, logical thinking, and problem-solving ability.
I am solving problems step by step, starting from easier exercises and gradually moving toward harder and more complex challenges.

## Goals

- Strengthen Java fundamentals

- Improve algorithmic thinking

- Practice data structures

- Build consistency through daily problem solving

- Track my learning progress over time

--- 

## Progress Strategy

1. Start with Easy problems

2. Move to Medium problems

3. Finally tackle Hard problems

4. Focus on:

    - Time complexity

    - Space complexity

    - Writing clean and efficient code
